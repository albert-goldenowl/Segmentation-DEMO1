<b>Semantic Segmentation</b> is the task that model will assign class to each pixel of an image. It provides much more detailed information about the image. To step into the world of segmentation, let's get started with a simple (but not really) project that segment shapes.
This repo provides an end-to-end pipeline to develope semantic segmentation models.
### Requires:
Shape Semantic Segmentation requires:
<ul>
<li><b>TensorFlow</b> (for building models).</li>
<li><b>OpenCV</b> (for image processing).</li>

<li><b>Numpy</b> (for working with multi-dimensional arrays).</li>
<li><b>PyQt5</b> (for GUI).</li>
<li><b>onnx</b> (for working with onnx files).</li>
<li><b>onnxruntime</b> (for much faster inference).</li>
<li><b>tf2onnx</b> (for converting TensorFlow model file to onnx 
format). </li>
<li><b>albumentations</b> (for image augmentation)</li>
<li><b>Matplotlib</b> (for visualization)</li>

</ul>
